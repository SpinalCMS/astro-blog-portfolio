I shouldn't be complaining about these lenses. They're awesome, all around great performers and beside the 16-35mm, they're all pretty compact.\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n    <picture>\r\n        <Image\r\n            file=\"/shoots/2019/2019-05-26-coffee-with-cars/coffee-with-cars-2019_001.jpg\"\r\n            classes=\"solid-shadow-blue\"\r\n        />\r\n    </picture>\r\n    <Caption file=\"/shoots/2019/2019-05-26-coffee-with-cars/coffee-with-cars-2019_001.jpg\" />\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\nI felt that I was too heavy on the lower focal range. Three lenses under 55mm seemed like a waste. I wasn't using the 35mm f/2.8 as much as I should. I figured it'd be a great travel lens, small and lightweight. But, for most of my shoots, I'm driving to the location and don't have to worry about size and weight.\r\n\r\nThe 16-35mm was great and I loved it for interior shots. But sometimes I'd find myself shooting the exterior of the car with that lens. The distortion was too much for anything other than those tight interior shots.\r\n\r\n## Down With the \"G\"\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n    <picture>\r\n        <Image\r\n            file=\"/shoots/2019/2019-05-26-coffee-with-cars/coffee-with-cars-2019_011.jpg\"\r\n            classes=\"solid-shadow-blue\"\r\n        />\r\n    </picture>\r\n    <Caption file=\"/shoots/2019/2019-05-26-coffee-with-cars/coffee-with-cars-2019_011.jpg\" />\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\nI've been eyeing the 24-70mm G Master. It seems too good to be true. But it's tough to stomach trading all my gear for a $2,300 lens. I'm not a professional, so I can't swallow that kind of price. Also, I'd be losing 8mm on the low side and only gaining about 15mm on the high side. Sure, it's nice having one lens instead of 3, but it's just not enough of an upgrade in regards to focal length.\r\n\r\nI've been reading about the SEL24105G that Sony recently released. Yep, it won't be quite as sharp as a \"GM\" but, it's close to half as expensive and would give me another 35mm of focal length. I do lose out on an extra stop of light, f/4 vs f/2.8. But again, for the cars I'm shooting, light isn't usually a problem and I like to shoot above f/4 to keep the car in focus. I've been happy with the performance so far in my tests. I haven't had a chance to shoot a car yet, but that should change next weekend.\r\n\r\nThe other lenses will be up for auction on eBay starting today.\r\n\r\n### Current Setup\r\n- Sony A7iii\r\n- Sony 24-105 G f/4"},{"slug":"2019-08-07-sigma-art-ruined-me","category":"photography","title":"Sigma Art Ruined Me","description":"On a whim I decided to try out a few of Sigma's Art Lenses.

They're so good I had to own one. Scratch that, two issues. They're amazing but also giant and heavy.\r\n\r\n### What's the harm, you rented. Right?\r\nThat's technically true. I used LensRentals.com (plug for an awesome company) to grab three Sigmas:\r\n- 85mm f/1.4 DG HSM Art\r\n- 50mm f/1.4 DG HSM Art\r\n- 24mm f/1.4 DG HSM Art\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n    <picture>\r\n        <Image\r\n            file=\"/shoots/2019/2019-08-17-signal-yellow-911/911s-targa_012.jpg\"\r\n            classes=\"solid-shadow-yellow\"\r\n        />\r\n    </picture>\r\n    <Caption file=\"/shoots/2019/2019-08-17-signal-yellow-911/911s-targa_012.jpg\" />\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n    <picture>\r\n        <Image\r\n            file=\"/shoots/2019/2019-08-17-signal-yellow-911/911s-targa_008.jpg\"\r\n            classes=\"solid-shadow-yellow\"\r\n        />\r\n    </picture>\r\n    <Caption file=\"/shoots/2019/2019-08-17-signal-yellow-911/911s-targa_008.jpg\" />\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\nFrom the first shot I was hooked. If you're solely concerned with image quality, go for the Sigma's. Outside of the G-Master line there's not much else that competes. Yes, they're absolutely huge and heavy. The 85mm is ridiculous in length and weight, and Sigma makes a 135mm!\r\n\r\nIt was a sad day when I sealed the box to return them back to LensRentals. I couldn't shake the need for the 50mm. Luckily I was able to work out a deal and got one, no cost to myself.\r\n\r\nMy greatest concern is the sheer size. They're really not portable at all unless you're only concerned in taking one lens with you. Seeing as I'm shooting cars most of the time, I need to be mobile. But, I'll throw caution to the wind and just enjoy the image quailty for the time being.\r\n\r\n### Current Setup\r\n- Sony A7iii\r\n- Sony 24-105 G f/4\r\n- Sigma 50mm f/1.4 DG HSM Art"},{"slug":"2020-01-27-last-lens-update-ever","category":"photography","title":"My Last Lens Update, Ever","description":"2 camera bodies and 11 lenses later, I've finally settled on a complete setup.

But it 100% would have been cheaper for me to rent the few times a year I was doing large shoots to figure out what I liked.\r\n\r\n## Size Matters\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n    <picture>\r\n        <Image\r\n            file=\"/shoots/2020/2020-02-29-lit-show-day-three/lit-show-2020_007.jpg\"\r\n            classes=\"solid-shadow-yellow\"\r\n        />\r\n    </picture>\r\n    <Caption file=\"/shoots/2020/2020-02-29-lit-show-day-three/lit-show-2020_007.jpg\" />\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\nIn the end, I shoot cars. That means I'm traveling to my destination. As much as I fell in love with the Sigma ART line, I just can't justify carrying those behemoths around. Not to mention I started using a Zhiyun Weebill-S gimbal and the 50mm Sigma f/1.4 pushes it's motors to the limits.\r\n\r\n## The Finale\r\nIn the end, I had to ask myself what was most important. I came up with two requirements:\r\n- Had to be a reasonable size and weight\r\n- Had to have a consistent photo style across the lineup\r\n\r\nIn the end, the Zeiss Batis lineup was the best fit. They're small-ish, relatively lightweight with great build quality. Also, whether I'm shooting interiors with the 18mm or exteriors with the 85mm, every photo will have a consistent look and feel.\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n    <picture>\r\n        <Image\r\n            file=\"/shoots/2020/2020-02-29-lit-show-day-three/lit-show-2020_012.jpg\"\r\n            classes=\"solid-shadow-yellow\"\r\n        />\r\n    </picture>\r\n    <Caption file=\"/shoots/2020/2020-02-29-lit-show-day-three/lit-show-2020_012.jpg\" />\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n### Final Setup\r\n- Sony A7iii\r\n- Zeiss Batis 18mm f/2.8\r\n- Zeiss Batis 25mm f/2.0\r\n- Zeiss Batis 40mm f/2.0\r\n- Zeiss Batis 85mm f/1.8"},{"slug":"2020-04-30-dynamic-bookmarks-in-google-chrome","category":"coding","title":"Dynamic Bookmarks in Google Chrome","description":"I needed a simple way to automatically create date ranges for bookmarks in Google Chrome","tags":["marketing","code","chrome"],"body":"\r\n## The Issue\r\nAs a digital marketer, I'm constantly loading Google Analytics to view site performance metrics. I have very specific requirements when looking at performance data in Analytics:\r\n\r\n- I need to compare year-over-year data, ie: 2020 vs. 2019\r\n- I need to make sure I'm comparing the same days of the week, ie: when comparing today vs. last year, I need to compare a Monday vs. Monday, but the dates don't line up nicely, so you're comparing the 22nd vs the 23rd last year.\r\n\r\nThis can be time consuming when using Google Analytics daily. You've got to load Analytics, get to the property, select the report and set your date ranges. After frustration set in, I resolved to figure out a method to build dynamic bookmarks in Google Chrome.\r\n\r\n### What's the Fix?\r\nLet's assume that we want to populate a Google Analytics report with the date range for the current day, versus the same day of the week last year. As I'm writing this on Thursday (4/30/2020), the script will compare to the same Thursday last year (5/02/2019).\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nThe first step is to build the current year's date. For this example we're going to use today's date.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// create a new JS date\r\nvar start_date = new Date();\r\n// seperate out the day, month and year\r\nvar start_dd = start_date.getDate();\r\n// add one since javascript starts at 0 for january\r\nvar start_mm = start_date.getMonth() + 1;\r\nvar start_yyyy = start_date.getFullYear();\r\n// analytics requires leading zeros for day and month\r\n\r\nif (start_dd < 10) { start_dd = '0' + start_dd; }\r\nif (start_mm < 10) { start_mm = '0' + start_mm; }\r\n\r\n// this is the final start date string    \r\nvar start = '' + start_yyyy + start_mm + start_dd;\r\n```\r\n\r\nCool, now we've got a date that looks like:\r\n```js\r\n20200430\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext we need to do something similiar, but move back exactly one year to the same day of the week.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar end_date = new Date();\r\n// adjust the date back one full year\r\nend_date.setMilliseconds(end_date.getMilliseconds() - 604800000 * 52);\r\nvar end_dd = end_date.getDate();\r\n// add one since javascript starts at 0 for january\r\nvar end_mm = end_date.getMonth() + 1;\r\nvar end_yyyy = end_date.getFullYear();\r\n// analytics requires leading zeros for day and month\r\nif (end_dd < 10) { end_dd = '0' + end_dd; }\r\nif (end_mm < 10) { end_mm = '0' + end_mm; }\r\n// the final comparison date string\r\nvar end = '' + end_yyyy + end_mm + end_dd;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow we've got the current date and comparison date, properly formattted for Analytics. Next let's build the URL necessary to load the report.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// insert the url of the report you'd like to load\r\n// I save custom reports and use those as the base url\r\nreturn\r\n    'https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#my-reports/**REPORTID**/%3F_u.date00%3D'\r\n    + start\r\n    + '%26_u.date01%3D'\r\n    + start\r\n    + '%26_u.date10%3D'\r\n    + end\r\n    + '%26_u.date11%3D'\r\n    + end\r\n    + '/'; \r\n```\r\n\r\nThere's one final piece of the puzzle. We need to wrap all the prior code in a function, then call that function to open a new tab.\r\n\r\n```js\r\njavascript:function url() {\r\n    // all the previous code\r\n    // gets loaded here\r\n};\r\n\r\n//tell chrome to open the window\r\nwindow.open(url(), \"_self\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Bugs and Things to Note\r\n- As of the time of writing this code, Google Chrome didn't like any comments. I assume that's because the bookmark in Google Chrome gets converted to one long string, so any comment in your code comments the rest of the code out.\r\n- For some reason if you open a new tab, then try to load the bookmark, nothing happens. If you try the bookmark in a loaded tab, it's fine. If you right click and open in a new tab, it's fine. Anyone have a fix for this?\r\n\r\n## Get the Code\r\nIf you want to see the full code, I've created a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/tusamni/1007292a8566ac5a7f7268626ee5f8ae).\r\n\r\n### What's Next?\r\nIn part two, I'll show you how to adopt this code to allow for other date ranges:\r\n- Yesterday\r\n- Last seven days\r\n- Month to date\r\n- Last month"},{"slug":"2020-02-27-lit-show-day-one","category":"car show","title":"LIT Show 2020 Part 1","description":"Day one at LIT Show 2020 takes us to CPR Classic, Wholesale California and the Sierra Madre Collection open house.","tags":["lit show","porsche","los angeles"],"body":"\r\nIf you're like me and have never heard of the [LIT Show](https://www.lalitandtoyshow.com/), it's a Porsche literature, toy and memorabilia show that takes place each year in Southern California.
