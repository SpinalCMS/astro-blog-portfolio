                <p>Lately, I've been shooting lots of cars for Bring a Trailer auctions. If you're in the Austin area and are interested in having your car photographed for an online auction site, <a href="/contact">let's chat!</a></p>
                <p>If I have some free time, you might catch me over at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CoffeeWithCars/">Coffee With Cars in Dripping Springs, TX</a>. It's currently hosted at Dreamland on the last Sunday of the month at 8am.</p>
                <p>Currently I'm shooting with a Sony Alpha A7iii and a host of Zeiss Batis lenses. I'm also always on the lookout for new Peak Design gear, everything they make is incredible.</p>
