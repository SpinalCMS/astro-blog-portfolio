If you're like me and have never heard of the [LIT Show](https://www.lalitandtoyshow.com/), it's a Porsche literature, toy and memorabilia show that takes place each year in Southern California. But that description from their website is selling it short. It's really a week long Porsche fest. Lots of cars everywhere, some for sale and most shops open their doors to enthusiasts. It's Porsche week in LA and it's glorious.
    
## Let's Get it Started
Our trip started with a visit to [CPR Classic](https://www.cprclassic.com/) in Fallbrook, CA. CPR has been in the Porsche restoration business for 40 years. Their facility is massive, spanning across multiple buildings. Each building holding numerous customer cars awaiting restoration.
